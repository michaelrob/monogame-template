monogame-template
===============

Since the monogame templates are a bit annoying and don't always work, this should suffice.
Its just a regular multiplatform project template, except it has the right code code c# 8 and should just compile and run.

### Requirements

- c# 8
- .NET Framework 4.7.2

### Instructions

- Clone or copy project into a new repository
- Change namespaces to something other than `monogame-template`
- Write your game
